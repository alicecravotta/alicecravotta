# Alice Cravotta
I'm a PhD student at the University of Padua, Italy

## Research Experience:
I completed my Master in Linguistics at the University of Padova with a thesis on Non-verbal communication of tv-news reporters in disaster situations under the supervision of Prof. Maria Grazia Busà. After that, I worked as a research assistant for the European FP7 project Slándáil (Security System for language and image analysis) as part of the team working on Speech and Nonverbal communication analytics, lead by Prof. Busà and coordinated by Prof. Khurshid Ahmad (Trinity College Dublin). I am currently a Ph.D. student at the University of Padova (Italy).

## Research Project:
I am looking at speech and gesture in L1 narration task. Specifically, I am focusing on the effects of encouraging and restraining the use of gestures on voice and prosody. I am working under the supervision of Prof. Busà in collaboration with Prof. Pilar Prieto (Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona).
